# DG6_FileIngestion_SchemaValidation
File ingestion and schema validation: Different ways of reading large data files (pandas, dask, chunksize, dictread, datatables, pyspark) have been explored and the most optimal way is suggested. 
Next, the parameterization has been performed to read any file and comparing the data format using yml file. Instead of hard coding the file name, a general format has been created which can be used to read any data file in the given format.
